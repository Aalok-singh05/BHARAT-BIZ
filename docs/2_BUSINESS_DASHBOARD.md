# 📊 The Business Dashboard: Your Command Center

While customers live on WhatsApp, the Business Owner commands the empire from the **Bharat-Biz Dashboard**. This "Glass Cockpit" provides real-time visibility and control over every aspect of the trade.

## 🛡️ The "Tinder for Orders" Approval Queue
Automated orders are great, but trust is key. The **Approval Queue** lets the owner review every AI-generated order before it becomes final.

- **Review**: See customer name, negotiation history, and total value.
- **Approve**: One click to confirm stock deduction and generate invoice.
- **Reject**: One click to cancel and notify the customer.
- **Edit**: Modify quantities or prices if the AI made a mistake.

## 📦 Live Inventory Management
Forget the dusty ledger book. 
- **Real-Time Tracking**: See exactly how many meters of "Blue Cotton" are in "Batch A" vs "Batch B".
- **Visuals**: Color-coded stock levels (Low Stock alerts).
- **Batch Management**: Track dye lots and individual rolls.

## 💰 Financial Health
- **Invoicing**: Automatic PDF generation with GST calculation.
- **Ledger**: Track who owes what. "Priya Boutique has a pending balance of ₹15,000".
- **Revenue**: Visual charts showing daily/weekly sales trends.

---

## 📝 Business Memory (The Second Brain)
The dashboard includes a "Business Memory" feed:
- **Activity Log**: "Rahul ordered 50m Silk", "Payment received from Ambika".
- **Notes**: "Call Supplier X on Monday", "Remind Sharma-ji about payment".
- **Alerts**: "Red Cotton stock is critical (< 50m)".
